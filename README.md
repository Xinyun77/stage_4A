# stage_4A

This contains my work during my internship. I have been accepted as an intern in the LICIT-ECO7 laboratory. 
I was taking part in the research work carried out by several members of the LICIT team as part of a European research project, the DIT4TraM (Distributed Intelligence and Technology for Traffic and Mobility Management) project. The aim of this internship is to implement the MnMs simu-
simulator MnMs(Multimodal Network Modelling and Simulation) on the city of Amsterdam to analyze the competition of on-demand mobility and car-sharing services.

The "stage_LI" file contains my programs for extracting, transforming and visualizing data from the Amsterdam transport network. 
It also contains the regression implementation for the MFD(Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram).  I've also implemented functions to analyze performance indicators for both vehicles and users.
